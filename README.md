# Biomedical-Images-Segmentation
White matter hyper intensities (WMH) is one of main consequences of small vessel disease.
Automated WMH segmentation techniques will play an important role in future clinical research
and practice. Technically, U-Net can yield more precise segmentations. However, it sometimes
depends on data augmentation or larger numbers of filters. To solve this problem, A new
architecture, Dense U-Net is proposed to reinforce feature use and to reduce the numbers of
parameters.
